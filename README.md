OpenStack Salt States
=====================

These states are flexible and extensible.

They are designed to do large multi-node deployments, and to allow for
auto-discovery of different services and addresses.

There are few requirements for use.

Where to put it
---------------

This repository is designed to be used as `$SALT_ROOT/openstack`. For
example, this will generally be `/srv/salt/openstack`.

This structure was chosen so that you can easily import it as a submodule
within a git repo with your other salt states (and possibly pillar data).
